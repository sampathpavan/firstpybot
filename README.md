             1.)To know the weather of a city in India.
             2.)To know the corona updates of a country.
             3.)To motivate a person who has pain in breakup or lost his/her loved ones.
             
DESCRIPTION : Firstly our bot greets the user and asks to enter the name of the user.Next the bot asks the user to choose an option which we mentioned in the above OBJECTIVE.
If the user selects option one then it gives the current weather report of a city
If the user selects option two then it gives the updates on corona
If the user selects option three then it further asks the options to select what type of motivation the user wants
             The further options in motivation are as follows:

             2.)Breakup
